                        Hi. I'm <span className="highlight">Rishat</span>. <br />
                        A human being for about 20 years.<br />
                        Tatar from Russia. <br />
                        I don't like <span className="highlight">universities</span> and prefer online education. It's not a complete substitute, but there might be something like that soon. Maybe I'll even partake in building it) <br />
                        Learned English watching cartoons and TV series. <br />
                        I'm starting to open up to the world. Feel free to contact me)
